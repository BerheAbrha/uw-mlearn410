### Find model parameters using EM 
The dataset below contains a model generated from a number of gaussians.  Use EM to find the model parameters
```{r}
dat = read.csv("tbd.csv")
# e.g.
# clusters = some_em_algorithm(dat,...)
```

### Find cluster topics using k means
The dataset below contains documents taken from several different topical areas.  Use nlp techniques to extract the words into vectors and weight them.
Use your choice of clustering technique to group the documents into clusters
```{r}
